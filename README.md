# Pre-built Workspace for My Development
I need to look for a pre-configured Gitpod workspace template to quickly launch projects. 
After conducting extensive searches in Gitpod's public areas, community repositories, 
and forums, I still haven't found a template that meets my needs. My software development is purely a personal hobby for learning and exercising creativity.

Technical terms related to computers:workspace、Gitpod、projects、Git

## Requirements for the workspace
These are my basic setup items I use when building a new website.

* PostgresSQL database
* Python
    * Django
* Node JS
    * React
* Heroku ready

These are my basic setup items I use when building a new website.

1. Data Persistence Layer
Database System: PostgreSQL 14+

Must support ACID transaction isolation level ≥ READ COMMITTED

Required extensions:

pg_trgm (fuzzy search optimization)

PostGIS (geospatial data support, if applicable)

2. Server-Side Runtime
Python 3.10+

Virtual environment management: poetry (replaces traditional pip+venv)

Django 4.2 LTS

Must enable ASGI mode (daphne/uvicorn)

Middleware requirements:
 3. Client-Side Runtime
Node.js 18 LTS (with Corepack enabled)

React 18+

State management: Must use Context API + useReducer (or Redux Toolkit)

Build toolchain:

Bundler: vite (replaces webpack)

CSS solution: CSS Modules + postcss-preset-env

4. Cloud Deployment Standards
Heroku Compatibility:

Must include:

Procfile (process declaration)
runtime.txt (Python version specification)

heroku-postbuild script (auto-installs Node dependencies)

Database connection:

Use dj-database-url to parse DATABASE_URL environment variable

5. Development Constraints
Code quality:

Python must pass mypy static type checking

React components must use TypeScript 5.0+

Security requirements:

Django setting SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS ≥ 63072000

Frontend prohibited from directly storing process.env sensitive variables
Optimization Highlights
Performance Optimization:

Vite for HMR (Hot Module Replacement) during development

Django select_related/prefetch_related to prevent N+1 queries

Observability:

Integrate prometheus-client to expose /metrics endpoint

IaC Practice:

Use heroku.yml for declarative deployments

## Steps run by gitpod
<!-- 杨常佑翻译的内容 -->
1. Start with prebuilt "workspace-postgresql"
2. Setups will create a database with the following:
    Item | parameter
    -----|----------
    Database Name | dev-project
    Username | djangodev
    Password | djangodev

** DO NOT USE ** the above settings in a production project. These are only to be used for development.

## Steps to Finish the Project
The environment is now prepared to start both a Django app and a React app. Here are the subsequent steps to complete the project setup.

First, visit GitHub and create a new repository. This will serve as the remote location to store your project's code.

Next, open the Command Line Interface (CLI). You need to set the origin URL of your local Git repository. You have two options based on your authentication preference. If you're using SSH, run the command git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<username>/<new_repo>. If you prefer HTTPS, use git remote set-url origin https://github.com/<username>/<new_repo>.

After that, in the CLI, create a new Django project in the current directory. Use the command django-admin startproject <project name> ..

Once the Django project is created, create a new Django app within it. In the CLI, run django-admin startapp <app name>.

Now, switch to the directory of the newly - created Django project. You can do this by running cd <project name>. Then, initialize a new React application using the command npx create-react-app <react app name>.

Finally, you need to update the Django settings. Usually, this involves making changes to files like settings.py. You'll integrate the new app, configure static files, and set up any necessary middleware in this step.

##  Update the Database Configuration in `settings.py`
<!--卢奕成修改---->
To connect the Django project to a local PostgreSQL database during development, update the `DATABASES` section in your `settings.py` file as follows:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',  # Use PostgreSQL as the database backend
        'NAME': 'dev-project',                                # Name of the PostgreSQL database
        'USER': 'djangodev',                                  # Database user
        'PASSWORD': 'djangodev',                              # Database password
        'HOST': 'localhost',                                  # Host where PostgreSQL is running
        'PORT': '',                                           # Leave blank to use default PostgreSQL port (5432)
    }
}
This configuration is suitable for local development environments
Note: For production environments, do not hardcode sensitive information like usernames and passwords in settings.py. Instead, use environment variables or a separate configuration management system.       <!--卢奕成修改---->

❓ Frequently Asked Questions
🛠️ Environment Configuration Issues
Q1: Database connection failure after Gitpod startup
When encountering django.db.utils.OperationalError:

Check if PostgreSQL service is running:

sudo service postgresql status  
# If not running, start the service  
sudo service postgresql start  
Verify database user permissions:

psql -U djangodev -d dev-project  
Dependency Management Issues
Q2: Version conflicts during Poetry dependency installation
Try these steps:

# Remove old dependencies  
poetry lock --no-update  
poetry install --sync  
# If forced update is required  
poetry update --dry-run  # Preview changes first  
poetry update  
Testing Issues
Q3: How to run type checks?
Built-in quality gates in the project:

# Python type checking  
poetry run mypy backend/  
# TypeScript type validation  
npm run type-check  (requires configuration in package.json)
